The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Do you think we should get rid of the room that asks for seven clothes in replacement of rooms with doors for each puzzle? (Pretty much, each room would be on a different floor.) I also thought about what if each floor had its own boss.  (This is starting to remind me of Crossbone Isle in Golden Sun.) I am not sure how we should do this, so this is only a thought. (You'd likely have to unlock each door by hitting a switch, I guess. (And even so, some floors might not have entry doors if they are devoted to another floor. Or they could just have doors to a small treaure room, or something.)
