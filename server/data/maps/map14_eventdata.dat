Today in efforts to try and stop massive uploading, and downloading for others, I put the project on a SVN Respitory on Google, via Git.
It has been a little over a year since I last touched this game, but I have finally been getting back into it. I changed some horrible font colors today, but more importantly OneMeenGamer, a new member, tried out for editor today. He was my first try out, and to say the least, he didn't do half bad.
